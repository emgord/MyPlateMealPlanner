# MyPlate Meal Planner
[MyPlate Meal Planner](http://myplatemealplan.herokuapp.com/) makes weekly meal planning easy. Plan meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner for each day of the week, and then add ingredients to create a well balanced meal. The app will track which food groups are represented in your meal and suggest which groups to add to create a more balanced meal. The app also creates a shopping list to track which ingredients you already have and which you need to add to your shopping list.
